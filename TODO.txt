small things:
- add links to main template
    -> overview/base.html (62)
- add pagnation to overviews
    ->https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/pagination/
- create script for autoinstall


Large things:
-Documentation:
    -> comments
    -> how to guide
    -> technical Documentation
    -> write Documentation about deploying to differnt serverices/servers

- create multi day task creation
    -> creationEngine/vieuws.py (167)
    -> creationEngine/forms.py (maybe set a max, or don't i'm not the police, but see deletion)

- Language support
    -> database classes
        -> create model
        -> create classes
        -> migrate
    -> add support
        -> write code @ overvieuw (self defined GLOBAL function)
            create list (dict) of words with corresponding keys for each langage (depending on langage selected by the user)
            then pass lsit to views (all views, thats why global)

    -> create cookie helper for language settings
        -> https://www.tutorialspoint.com/django/django_cookies_handling.htm
        -> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/http/sessions/
    -> set up button in overview/base.html
    -> add all words to language list (and be ready to support other langages)

- imageCreator
    -> create new applciation
    $> python manage.py createApp imageCreator
    -> the goal of this is that the user can create images that get directly mapped to a url for use in the mobile applucation(s). 
        -> File upload classes
            -> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/files/
        -> Url creator functions
            -> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/files/storage/#the-filesystemstorage-class
        -> database access + (custom forms for adding these to the database classes, @ activityImage)
            -> models.py
        -> self aware dns/ip mapping (this one is going to be fun, maybe create a settings app --> further expansions)

- activity templates
    -> most doable one
        create a sort of template engine, the user selects a template, this gets loaded into the activity creation form, (one of them at least)
        the user is also able to CRUD his own templates. 

- multiDelete
    -> now every task has to be deleted seperatly, create something that allows multiple tasks to be deleted simultainiously.
